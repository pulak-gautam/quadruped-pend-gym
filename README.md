## Inverted Pendulum balancing on Quadruped using off-policy RL
This repository consists of a gymnasium environment which implements a reinforcement learning environment to facilitate training controllers for balancing inverted pendulum on a quadruped.

Currently, only Unitree's **Go2** with **TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG)** algorithm is supported out-of-the-box. The codebase follows modular structure and it is easy to add other models and algorithms.
